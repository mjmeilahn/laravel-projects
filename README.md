# LARAVEL 
One repo that contains a list of my Laravel pet projects. These projects were my first introduction to MVC frameworks so the implementation of these projects are quite specific and bare-bones.

1. Sanitation - https://meilahn-encryption-sanitize.herokuapp.com/ - Please allow 20 - 25 seconds for app to "wake up" on its Free Hosting plan. App uses PHP7 encryption best practices by data validation, sanitization and encryption. Both sanitized and encrypted outputs are escaped before rendered on page.

2. API Authentication - https://meilahn-instagram.herokuapp.com/ - Please allow 20 - 25 seconds for app to "wake up" on its Free Hosting plan. App uses Instagram API to retrieve a live feed from my Instagram account. This was my first ever Laravel pet project. Colorful graphic designs are from my Photoshop pet projects in 2011.
